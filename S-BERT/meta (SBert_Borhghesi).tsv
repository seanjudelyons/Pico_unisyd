1 most esteemed fathers, i have read in the ancient texts of the arabians that when abdallah the saracen was questioned as to what on this world’s stage, so to speak, seemed to him most worthy of wonder, he replied that there is nothing to be seen more wonderful than man.
2 this opinion is seconded by mercury’s saying: “a great miracle, asclepius, is man.”  still, when i considered the reasons behind these maxims, i was unsatisfied by the arguments put forward by many men to explain the excellence of human nature: that man is the intermediary between creatures, a companion of the higher beings, a king of the things beneath him; that, by the acuity of his senses, by the discernment of his reason and by the light of his intelligence he was the interpreter of nature; that man is the midpoint between fixed eternity and fleeting time, the bond (as the persians say) or rather the wedding-song of the world, and only slightly inferior, as david affirms, to the angels.
3 these reasons are indeed great, but they are nonetheless not the principal ones.
4 that is, they are not the main grounds on which man may rightfully claim for himself the privilege of the highest admiration.
5 indeed, why then would we not find the angels themselves and the blessed choirs of heaven even more admirable?
6 at length, it seemed to me that i had come to understand why man is the most fortunate of beings and therefore worthy of all admiration, and what finally is the condition that befell him in the universal order, a condition to be envied not only by beasts but even by the stars and the intelligences dwelling beyond this world.
7 a thing surpassing belief, and wondrous too!
8 and why not?
9 since, for this very reason, man is rightly called, and thought to be, a great miracle and a being worthy of all admiration.
10 but hear, fathers, exactly what this condition is and, while you listen benevolently, kindly indulge me in my endeavour.
11 in accordance with the laws of his mysterious wisdom, god the supreme father and architect had already fashioned this worldly home we behold, this most sacred temple of his divinity.
12 he had already adorned the supercelestial region with intelligences, enlivened the heavenly globes with eternal souls, and filled the excremental and filthy parts of the lower world with a multitude of forms of animal life.
13 but when the work was finished, the craftsman still longed for there to be someone to ponder the meaning of such a magnificent achievement, to love its beauty and to marvel at its vastness.
14 so, when everything was done (as moses and timaeus testify), he finally thought to bring forth man.
15 but there was nothing among his archetypes from which he could mould a new progeny, nor was there anything in his storehouses that he might bestow upon his new son as an inheritance, nor was there among the seats of the world any place for this contemplator of the universe.
16 every place was by then filled; all things had already been assigned to the highest, the middle, and the lowest orders.
17 but it was not in the nature of the father’s power to fail, as if exhausted, in his final creation.
18 it was not in the nature of his wisdom to hesitate, as if at a loss, when faced with a necessary task.
19 nor was it in the nature of his beneficent love to have one who would praise divine generosity in all other things be forced to find it blameworthy in regard to himself.
20 at length, the master creator decreed that the creature to whom he had been unable to give anything wholly his own should share in common whatever belonged to every other being.
21 he therefore took man, this creature of indeterminate image, set him in the middle of the world, and said to him: “we have given you, adam, no fixed seat or form of your own, no talent peculiar to you alone.
22 this we have done so that whatever seat, whatever form, whatever talent you may judge desirable, these same may you have and possess according to your desire and judgment.
23 once defined, the nature of all other beings is constrained within the laws we have prescribed for them.
24 but you, constrained by no limits, may determine your nature for yourself, according to your own free will, in whose hands we have placed you.
25 we have set you at the centre of the world so that from there you may more easily gaze upon whatever it contains.
26 we have made you neither of heaven nor of earth, neither mortal nor immortal, so that you may, as the free and extraordinary shaper of yourself, fashion yourself in whatever form you prefer.
27 it will be in your power to degenerate into the lower forms of life, which are brutish.
28 alternatively, you shall have the power, in accordance with the judgment of your soul, to be reborn into the higher orders, those that are divine.”   as soon as they are born, brutes bring with them from their mother’s womb, as lucilius says, all that they are going to possess.
29 the intelligences have been, either from the beginning or soon thereafter, what they are perpetually going to be throughout eternity.
30 the father infused in man, at his birth, every sort of seed and all sprouts of every kind of life.
31 these seeds will grow and bear fruit in each man who sows them.
32 if he cultivates his vegetative seeds, he will become a plant.
33 if he cultivates his sensitive seeds, he will become a brute animal.
34 if he cultivates his rational seeds, he will become a heavenly being.
35 if he cultivates his intellectual seeds, he will be an angel and a son of god.
36 and if he – being dissatisfied with the lot assigned to any other creature – gathers himself into the centre of his own unity, thus becoming a single spirit with god in the solitary darkness of the father, he, who had been placed above all things, will become superior to all things.
37 ﻿who will not wonder at this chameleon of ours?
38 or rather, who will admire any other being more?
39 not without reason, asclepius the athenian said that man was represented in the secret rites by proteus because of his changing and metamorphous nature.
40 hence the metamorphoses renowned among the jews and the pythagoreans.
41 indeed, even the most secret hebrew theology at one time transforms holy enoch into an angel of divinity, whom they call [] metatron, and at other times it reshapes other men into other spirits.
42 according to pythagoreans, wicked men are deformed into brutes and, if empedocles is to be believed, into plants as well.
43 imitating them, mohammed frequently remarked that he who strays from divine law becomes a brute.
44 and, indeed, rightly so.
45 it is not in fact the bark that makes the plant, but dull and insentient nature; not the hide that makes a beast of burden, but a brutish and sensuous soul; not the circular body that makes the heavens, but straightforward reason; not the separation from the body that makes an angel, but its spiritual intelligence.
46 if you see someone who is a slave to his belly, crawling along the ground, it is not a man you see, but a plant; if you see someone who is enslaved by his own senses, blinded by the empty hallucinations brought on by fantasy (as if by calypso herself) and entranced by their bedevilling spells, it is a brute animal you see, not a man.
47 if you see a philosopher discerning things with right reason, worship him, for he is not an earthly creature, but divine.
48 if you see a pure contemplator, oblivious to his body and absorbed in the recesses of his mind, this is neither an earthly nor a heavenly creature: this is a still more eminent spirit, clothed in human flesh.
49 who, then, will not admire man?
50 not undeservedly, in mosaic and christian scripture he is sometimes called “all flesh” and sometimes “every creature,” insofar as he fashions, shapes, and transforms his own appearance into that of all flesh, his own character into that of every creature.
51 accordingly, evanthes the persian, writing on chaldean theology, says man possesses no innate image, but many that are extrinsic and acquired.
52 hence that saying of the chaldeans []; that is, “man is by nature diverse, multiform and inconstant.”  yet, why go on about this?
53 so that we may understand that we (having been born into this condition; that is, born with the possibility to become what we wish to be) must take the greatest care, lest people say of us that we, although held in high esteem, did not realize that we had turned ourselves into brutes and mindless beasts of burden.
54 let us instead recall the saying of asaph the prophet: “you are all gods and sons of the most high.” thus may we avoid abusing the most indulgent liberality of the father by transforming the free choice he bestowed upon us from something beneficial to something harmful.
55 let our souls be pervaded by a certain holy and junonian ambition so that we, not satisfied with what is mediocre, may aspire to what is loftiest, and may apply ourselves with all our strength in that pursuit, for we shall succeed if we are so minded.
56 let us spurn the terrestrial, disdain the celestial; disregarding all that is of this world, let us fly off to the otherworldly court that is near to the most eminent divinity.
57 there, according to the sacred mysteries, seraphim, cherubim, and thrones occupy the first places; let us emulate their dignity and glory, unwilling as we are to yield to them and unable to endure second place.
58 if so we wish, we will not be inferior to them at all.
59 but in what way, or by doing what?
60 let us consider what they do, what life they lead.
61 if we too live that life (and indeed we can), we will be equal to their lot.
62 the seraph burns with the fire of love; the cherub shines with the splendour of intelligence; the throne stands in the steadfastness of judgment.
63 therefore, if we, being dedicated to an active life, undertake the care of inferior things with proper consideration of their worth, we will be strengthened by the steadfast solidity of the thrones.
64 if we, being unburdened by actions, meditate on the creator in his creation and on creation in the creator, we shall be engaged in the tranquillity of contemplation; we shall shine on all sides with cherubic light.
65 if we burn for the creator alone, with charity, with its all-consuming fire, we shall burst into flame in the likeness of the seraphim.
66 upon the throne, that is, upon the just judge, sits god, the judge of all time.
67 over the cherub, that is, over the contemplator, he flies and, as if brooding over him, imbues him with warmth.
68 indeed, the spirit of the lord is carried over the waters, the waters that, i say, are above the heavens and that praise god in the pre-dawn hymns in the book of job.
69 he who is a seraph, that is, a lover, is in god and god is in him; indeed, he and god are one.
70 great is the power of the thrones that we may reach by judging; supreme is the height of the seraphim that we may reach by loving.
71 and yet in what manner can anyone either judge or love things unknown?
72 moses loved the lord whom he saw.
73 as a judge, moses administered to the people the things that he earlier saw on the mountain as a contemplator.
74 hence, the cherub, located in the middle position, uses his light both to prepare us for the seraphic fire and likewise to illuminate for us the judgment of the thrones.
75 the cherub is the bond of the prime minds, the order of pallas, the overseer of contemplative philosophy.
76 first we must emulate him, thirst after him and to the same degree understand him in order that we may be raised from him to the heights of love and descend from him, well taught and prepared, to the duties of the active life.
77 and yet, if our life is to be modelled on the example of the cherub’s, it is worth our while to have before our eyes an idea of what life they lead and what it is like, what their duties are and what they do.
78 inasmuch as we, who are flesh and have the smell of earthly things, are not permitted to follow their model of our own accord, let us consult the ancient fathers, for they, to whom these things were common and well known, can provide us with certain and abundant evidence of their nature.
79 let us inquire of the apostle paul, the chosen vessel, regarding the activities of the cherubic hosts whom he saw when raised up to the third heaven.
80 he will certainly answer, according to the interpretation of dionysius, that they are cleansed, then illuminated, and afterward are perfected.
81 so too, emulating the cherubic life on earth, curbing the drive of the emotions through moral science, dispersing the darkness of reason through dialectics (as if washing away the squalor of ignorance and vice), may we purge our souls, lest our emotions run amok or our reason imprudently run off course at any time.
82 then may we imbue our purified and well-prepared soul with the light of natural philosophy so that afterward we may perfect it with the knowledge of things divine.
83 and lest we be satisfied by those of our own, let us also consult jacob the patriarch, whose image shines, chiselled in the dwelling place of glory.
84 the most wise father, asleep in the lower world and awake in the higher, will illuminate us.
85 but he will teach us through a figure (in this way all things were known to them) that there is a ladder that stretches from the lowest earth to the highest heavens and that is marked by a series of many rungs.
86 god is at its height, and the contemplative angels move up and down it in turns.
87 yet, if we are to carry out these things in our efforts to imitate the angelic life, who, i ask, will dare to touch the ladder of god, either with unclean feet or with unwashed hands?
88 it is unlawful, as the mysteries have it, to touch the clean with the unclean.
89 but what feet are these?
90 what hands?
91 to be sure, the foot of the soul is that part which is most despicable, that which leans upon matter as if on earthly soil; it is the faculty, i say, that feeds and nourishes; it is, i say, the kindling wood of lust and the teacher of sensual weakness.
92 and why not call the hands of the soul its irascible part, that which fights on behalf of desire, battles for it, and like a plunderer takes away in broad daylight and the public arena the things that desire, resting in the shade, then devours?
93 these hands, these feet, are the entire sensual part of the body in which resides the attraction that drags the soul back, as they say, obtorto collo.
94 let us wash them in moral philosophy as in a flowing river lest we be held back from the ladder as wicked and unclean.
95 and yet not even this will be enough if we wish to be companions of the angels who hasten up and down jacob’s ladder unless we are first well prepared and instructed to be promoted from step to step, to wheel away nowhere from the course of the ladder, and to face their movements to and fro.
96 once we, inspired by the cherubic spirit, have reached this point through the art of speaking or of reasoning – that is, philosophizing according to the grades of nature, penetrating the whole from the centre to the centre – then shall we descend, dashing the one into many with titanic force like osiris, and ascend, drawing together with phoebean might the many into one, like osiris’s limbs, until at last, resting in the bosom of the father who is at the top of the ladder, we shall be made perfect in theological bliss.
97 and let us inquire of just job, who entered into a living pact with the god of life before he was brought into being, as to what god the highest desires among those tens of hundreds of thousands who are there present before him.
98 he will certainly answer “peace,” in accordance with what is written in the book of job: “he who makes peace in the heavens.”  and since the middle order interprets the precepts of the supreme order for the lower ones, let now empedocles the philosopher interpret for us the words of job the theologian.
99 empedocles, as his songs attest, presents to us through the symbols of strife and friendship, or of war and peace, the dual nature that is set in our souls: one of them lifts us upwards to the heavens and the other drags us down into the depths.
100 in these songs, he deplores being tossed upon the seas, driven by conflict and discord like a madman and banished from the gods.
101 manifold indeed, fathers, is the discord in us; we have grave internal, more than civil, wars in our home.
102 they are such that, if we desire them not, if we yearn after that peace which will lift us up and set us among god’s most exalted ones, only philosophy will be able to still the troubles within us and bring us calm.
103 if our man would just seek a truce from his enemies, moral philosophy will beat down the unbridled stampede of the manifold beast and the aggression, ire, and arrogance of the lion.
104 then, if we yearn right-mindedly for the safety of perpetual peace for ourselves, it will come and liberally satisfy our desires; indeed, both beasts having been sacrificed like a stuck sow, it will ratify an everlasting pact of the most holy peace between the flesh and the spirit.
105 dialectics will calm the tumults of reason agitated and tossed about between the contradictions of speech and the captiousness of syllogisms.
106 natural philosophy will allay the differences of opinion and disagreements that vex, perplex, and afflict our restless soul from all sides.
107 but it will bring harmony in such a way as to remind us that nature is the offspring of war, as heraclitus said, and is therefore called “strife” by homer.
108 thus, it is said that in philosophy true rest and stable peace cannot reveal themselves to us alone, that this is the duty and privilege of its mistress; that is, of the most holy theology.
109 she will show us the way to this peace and like a companion will lead us.
110 seeing us hurrying along from afar, she will call out, “come to me, you who exert yourselves in vain; come and i will restore you; come to me and i will give you that peace which the world and nature cannot give to you.”   so gently called, so kindly invited, we will then fly away into the embrace of the most blessed mother like terrestrial mercuries with winged feet and will rejoice in the longed-for peace.
111 this is that most holy peace, the indissoluble bond, the harmonious friendship in which all souls, in one mind (a mind that is above all minds) are not only in agreement but, indeed, in a certain ineffable way, inwardly become one.
112 this is the friendship that the pythagoreans call the end of all philosophy, that peace which god makes in his heavens, which the angels who came down to earth announced to men of good will so that these men would, ascending to heaven, be transformed by it into angels.
113 let us desire this peace for our friends, for our times; let us desire it for whatever home we enter.
114 let us desire it for our soul so that in her may be made a house of the lord, so that, after casting off her impurities through moral philosophy and dialectics, our soul may adorn herself with multifaceted philosophy, as if with royal magnificence, and so that she may crown the heights of her doors with the garlands of theology.
115 and let us desire this peace for our soul so that the king of glory may descend at last, together with the father, to make a home in her.
116 if our soul shows herself to be worthy of such a guest – for his clemency is immense – she (clad in gold, as in a wedding toga, and surrounded by a diverse variety of sciences) will receive her handsome guest not merely as a guest but as a bridegroom.
117 so as not to be separated from him, she will wish to be separated from her people.
118 having forgotten her own father’s home – indeed, having forgotten herself – she will wish to die in herself so that she may live in her spouse, in whose sight the death of his saints is truly precious.
119 this is the death, i say (if one must call that plenitude of life death), whose contemplation is, according to the sages, the study of philosophy.
120 let us take as an example moses, who is himself but a bit inferior to the fountain-like fullness of sacrosanct and ineffable intelligence whose nectar inebriates the angels.
121 we will hear the venerable judge thus declare his laws to us who live in the empty solitude of this body: “let those who are unclean and as yet in need of moral philosophy dwell with the masses outside the tabernacle in the open air while they purify themselves like the priests of thessaly.
122 ﻿let those who have already put their behaviour in order and have been received into the sanctuary not yet lay hands upon the sacred things, but first, in the service of dialectics, let them serve the holy things of philosophy like diligent levites.
123 once they are allowed access to the holy things in the priesthood of philosophy, let them contemplate the multicoloured aspect of the higher kingdom of god; that is, the divine, princely decoration, as well as ﻿the celestial candelabra adorned with seven lights.
124 let them behold the skins so that they, permitted at last into the recesses of the temple through the merits of theological sublimity, may rejoice in the glory of the divinity without any veil of a likeness coming in between.”  these things moses truly commands of us and in commanding instructs, incites, and encourages so that through philosophy we may prepare for ourselves, while we are able, the path to the future celestial glory.
125 in fact, however, not only the mosaic and christian mysteries but also the theology of the ancients shows us the dignity and value of the liberal arts, which i came to discuss.
126 for at what else, by hercules!
127 was the observance of the different degrees of initiation in greek mysteries aimed?
128 only after having been purified through moral philosophy and dialectics, those arts that we might call expiatory, could the initiates gain entrance to the mysteries.
129 and what else can such an initiation possibly signify if not an understanding, achieved through philosophy, of nature’s most mysterious things?.
130 tum demum ita dispositis illa adveniebat ποπτεα, idest rerum divinarum per theologiae lumen inspectio.
131 only then did that ποπτεα, the intimate vision of divine things by the light of theology, come to those who were so disposed.
132 who would not yearn to be initiated into such sacred rites?
133 who, leaving behind all human concerns, scorning the goods of fortune and pleasures of the body, would not wish to become a guest at the table of the gods while still alive on earth and, inebriated by the nectar of eternity, to receive, though still a mortal creature, the gift of immortality?
134 who would not wish to be so inspired by those socratic frenzies, which plato celebrates in the phaedrus, that he is whisked away to the heavenly jerusalem, soaring from here – that is, from this world set on evil – with oarlike strokes of wings and feet?
135 let us be led away, fathers, let us be led away by the socratic frenzies that will so lift us beyond our minds as to put our mind and ourselves in god!
136 they will surely lead us away – but only once we ourselves have taken control of what is ours.
137 if, through moral philosophy, the forces of our passions have been guided correctly toward their proper ends (in such a way that they produce together a lasting harmony) and if, through dialectics, our reason has moved along at the proper pace, only then, stirred by the frenzy of the muses, shall we drink in that heavenly harmony with our inmost hearing.
138 then, through his mysteries (that is, through the visible signs of nature), bacchus, the leader of the muses, will show the invisible things of godto those of us who pursue philosophy and will make us drunk with the abundance of god’s house; and if we, like moses, prove faithful in all god’s house, most sacred theology shall draw close to us, animating us with a twofold frenzy.
139 for, raised to her most eminent heights, and thence comparing to indivisible eternity all things that are and shall be and have been, we shall be the phoebean seers of those things; and, admiring that primeval beauty, we shall become its winged lovers.
140 and at last, roused by ineffable love as if by a frenzy, and borne outside ourselves like ardent seraphim, filled with the godhead, we shall no longer be ourselves, but he himself who made us.
141 the sacred names of apollo, if anyone investigates their meanings and hidden mysteries, sufficiently show that god is, no less than a seer, a philosopher.
142 but since ammonius has amply examined this matter, there is no reason for me to treat it further.
143 instead, fathers, let us call to mind the three delphic precepts, which are absolutely necessary to those who are to enter the most holy and august temple, not of the false but of the true apollo, who illuminates every soul that comes into this world; you will realize that they exhort us to do nothing other than embrace with all our strength the tripartite philosophy that we now discuss.
144 for the famous maxim μηδν γαν (that is, “nothing too much”) rightly prescribes as rule and norm for every virtue the criterion of the “mean,” of which moral philosophy speaks.
145 then the maxim γνθι σεαυτν (that is, “know thyself”) urges and exhorts us to the knowledge of all nature, of which the nature of man is the intermediary and, so to speak, the mixture.
146 for he who knows himself in himself knows all things, as was first written by zoroaster and later by plato in the alcibiades.
147 finally, once natural philosophy has enlightened us with this knowledge, we, being very close to god and saying ε (that is, “you are”), shall address by a theological salutation the true apollo on intimate and likewise blissful terms.
148 but let us also consult the exceedingly wise pythagoras, wise precisely because he never deemed himself worthy of that name.
149 he will first advise us “not to sit on a bushel” – that is, not to lose that rational faculty through which the soul measures, judges, and considers all things – by abandoning it to sloth and inaction; rather, he will advise us by the exercise and the rule of dialectics to direct and to stimulate that faculty assiduously.
150 then he will point out to us two things to be avoided above all: that is, making water facing the sun and trimming our nails while offering sacrifice.
151 but after we have urinated away the dissolute appetites of our overflowing pleasures through moral philosophy and pared away, like nail clippings, the sharp points of wrath and the spines of animosity, only then shall we finally begin to take part in the sacred rites, that is, in the abovementioned mysteries of bacchus, and to dedicate ourselves to that contemplation of which the sun is rightly called the father and guide.
152 finally pythagoras will exhort us “to feed the cock”– that is, to nourish the divine part of our soul – with the knowledge of divine things, as if with solid food and heavenly ambrosia.
153 this is the cock whose sight fills the lion – that is, all earthly power – with fear and awe.
154 this is the cock to whom, as we read in job, intelligence was given.
155 when this cock crows, the erring man comes to his senses.
156 in the dawn twilight, this cock sings each day with the morning stars in praise of god.
157 this is the cock that the dying socrates, when – now out of danger of all bodily illness – he was hoping to join the divine part of his soul to the divinity of the greater world, said he owed to aesculapius; that is, to the physician of souls.
158 but let us also review the writings of the chaldeans, and we shall see (if they are trustworthy) that it is by these same arts that the road to happiness is made accessible to mortals.
159 the chaldean interpreters write that it was a saying of zoroaster’s that the soul is winged and, when its wings fall off, it plummets into the body; but once the wings have regrown, it flies back to heaven.
160 when his disciples asked him how they too might obtain souls with well-plumed wings and the ability to fly, he replied: “soak them well in the waters of life.”   and when they asked him where they might look for such waters, he answered them with a parable (as was his custom): “god’s paradise is irrigated and cleansed by four rivers.
161 from these you may draw the waters that will save you.
162 the name of the river that flows from the north is […], which means the right; that which flows from the west is named […], which means expiation; that which comes from the east is named […], that is, light; while that from the south is […], which may be translated as piety.”   now consider carefully and with your full attention, fathers, what these doctrines of zoroaster represent.
163 they surely mean nothing other than to induce us to wash away with moral philosophy, as in the iberian waves, the filth from our eyes, and to straighten our gaze by dialectics, as if by the northern line.
164 then we should accustom our eyes, in the contemplation of nature, to endure the still feeble light of truth, like the first rays of the rising sun, so that through theological piety and the most holy worship of the gods, we finally become able to endure, like heavenly eagles, the dazzling splendour of the midday sun.
165 these are, perhaps, those celebrated morning, midday, and evening thoughts first sung by david and then given a wider explanation by augustine.
166 this is the noonday light that squarely enflames the seraphim and equally illuminates the cherubim.
167 this is the region toward which our ancient father abraham was ever advancing.
168 this is the place where, according to the doctrines of the cabalists and the moors, there is no place for unclean spirits.
169 and, if it may be permitted, even in the form of a riddle, to bring anything at all of the most hidden mysteries into the open (inasmuch as the sudden fall from heaven has condemned the head of our man to dizziness and, according to jeremiah, death has come in through the windows to smite our livers and breasts), let us call upon raphael, the heavenly physician, to set us free with moral philosophy and dialectics, as if with healing drugs.
170 then, once we have been restored to health, gabriel, the strength of god, will abide in us and, leading us through the marvels of nature and showing us everywhere the merit and the power of god, he will finally deliver us to michael the high priest, who will in turn bestow upon us, who will have completed our service to philosophy, the insignia of theological priesthood, as if a crown of precious stones.
171 these are the reasons, most reverend fathers, that have not only encouraged me but even thrust upon me the duty of studying philosophy.
172 and i would certainly not elaborate on them if i were not compelled to respond to those who are accustomed to condemning the study of philosophy, especially in men of high rank or, even more generally, in those of a middling fortune.
173 for philosophizing as a whole (and this is the misfortune of our age!)
174 is now derided and disparaged, instead of being honoured and glorified.
175 thus, nearly everyone’s mind has been invaded by the ruinous and monstrous conviction that either no one or only a very few may study philosophy, as if having before our eyes and at our fingertips the causes of things, the ways of nature, the logic of the universe, the divine plan, and the mysteries of heaven and earth were of no value whatsoever unless accompanied by the possibility of garnering some favour or making a profit.
176 indeed, it has now reached the point (what sorrow!)
177 that only those who reduce the study of wisdom to a business are considered wise.
178 it is like seeing chaste pallas, who dwells among men out of the generosity of the gods, rejected, hooted off and hissed at, with no one to love or protect her, lest she, like a prostitute who accepts a pittance for her deflowered virginity, deposit the ill-earned profit into her lover’s money chest.
179 and i say all these things (not without the deepest grief and indignation) not against the lords of our times but against the philosophers who believe and openly declare that no one should pursue philosophy if only because there is no market for philosophers, no remuneration given to them, as if they did not reveal in this very word that they are not true philosophers.
180 hence, insofar as their whole life has been dedicated to moneymaking and ambition, they are incapable of embracing the knowledge of truth for its own sake.
181 this much shall i grant myself (and i shall not blush a bit for self-praise in this regard): that i have never pursued philosophy for any other reason than for the sake of being a philosopher, nor have i ever hoped for or sought from my studies, from my queries, any reward or fruit beyond the nourishment of my mind and the knowledge of the truth, something i have always very greatly desired.
182 and i have always been so avid for it and so enamoured of it that, setting aside all private and public concerns, i devoted my whole self to the leisure of contemplation, from which no calumny of the envious, no slander of the enemies of wisdom, has thus far managed to distract me, nor will it in the future.
183 philosophy herself has taught me to rely upon my own conscience rather than upon the opinions of others, and always to be careful, not so much that people do not speak badly of me as, rather, that i not say or do anything that is in itself bad.
184 in fact, most reverend fathers, i was not unaware that this proposed debate of mine would be just as welcome and enjoyable to all of you who promote the good arts and have honoured this discussion with your most august presence as, on the contrary, it would be bothersome and unpleasant to many others.
185 i furthermore realize both that there has been no lack of men who criticized my undertaking from the outset and that they still continue to do so for a variety of reasons.
186 in truth, endeavours directed sincerely and righteously toward the attainment of virtue have always faced no fewer (indeed, often more) hecklers than those directed sinfully and wrongly toward vice.
187 there are, admittedly, some who frown upon both this style of debate and the very institution of publicly disputing matters of learning.
188 they claim that such discussions are better suited to the flaunting of wit and the display of erudition than to the acquisition of knowledge.
189 there are also others who, though not critical of this kind of exercise in itself, entirely disapprove of it in me who, born just twenty-four years ago, have at my age dared to propose a discussion on the sublime mysteries of christian theology, on the most profound questions of philosophy, and on unexplored fields of knowledge, all in such a famous city, before a vast assembly of learned men and in the presence of the apostolic senate.
190 still others, although they allow me the right to debate, do not wish to grant me the permission to dispute nine hundred theses, for they wrongfully consider the task and my desire to participate in it to be as superfluous and presumptuous as it is beyond the reach of my intellect.
191 i would have readily given in to their objections had i been so taught by the philosophy that i profess; nor would i now attempt to respond to them, even with the guidance of philosophy, if i believed that this debate among us had been opened with the purpose of fighting and quarrelling.
192 therefore, let us rid from our minds any intention to disparage and disquiet, as well as the ill will that plato assures us is absent from the divine chorus.
193 let us instead amiably consider both whether i am to begin this discussion and whether i should entertain so large a number of theses.
194 first, with regard to those who maliciously criticize this use of public disputation, i shall say very little, since this blunder, if we must call it so, has been committed on numerous occasions not only by me and by all of you, most eminent doctors, who have engaged quite often in it (and not without high honour and praise), but also by plato, aristotle, and all the most revered philosophers of every age.
195 these men were certain that, in order to achieve the knowledge for which they searched, nothing was more beneficial than wholehearted engagement in the practice of debate.
196 in fact, just as the body’s muscles become robust through gymnastics, undoubtedly so too, in this literary gymnasium of sorts, do the forces of the mind become far firmer and more vigorous.
197 nor would i believe that the poets, in their singing of the arms of pallas, and the hebrews in saying that  [barzel], “iron,” is the symbol  [shel-ha-hakhamim], “of wise men,” can mean nothing other than that this honourable pursuit of public debate is absolutely essential to the attainment of wisdom.
198 perhaps this is why the chaldeans hope to see in the horoscope of one who is to become a philosopher that mars faces mercury from three separate angles; it is almost as if all philosophy would become sluggish and drowsy were it not for the existence of these conflicts and debates.
199 it is more difficult for me, though, to defend myself against those who pronounce me unequal to this undertaking.
200 if i in fact declare myself equal to it, it seems i shall be accused of immodesty and of having an excessively high opinion of myself.
201 if, instead, i admit that i am unequal to it, i shall be charged with recklessness and imprudence.
202 see what difficulties i face, what task awaits me, since i cannot blamelessly promise about myself something i must then fulfil without blame.
203 i can refer, perhaps, to job’s famous saying that the spirit exists in all men, and find comfort in what timothy was told: “let no man despise thy young age.”   to speak, though, from my own conscience, i could say with all sincerity that there is nothing great or singular about me.
204 while i strongly uphold my own eager commitment to the good arts, i do not assume or expect the title of scholar.
205 thus, though i have taken a great burden upon my shoulders, it was most certainly not because i am unaware of my weaknesses; rather, i recognize that in this particular kind of clash – that is, one of a literary nature – there is profit in defeat.
206 consequently, those who are weakest should, rather than disparaging such contests, have the right, indeed the obligation, voluntarily to seek them out.
207 he who has been defeated receives not an injury from the winner but an advantage, for, thanks to him, he returns home richer; that is, wiser and better equipped for future contests.
208 though i am but a weak soldier, i am nonetheless enlivened by this hope, and i have no fear of combat in so difficult a battle against the strongest and most vigorous adversaries.
209 whether or not this initiative was reckless will be best decided not from my age but from the final outcome of the battle.
210 it remains in the third place for me to respond to those who take offence at the very large number of my propositions, as if this burden lay on their shoulders and it were not instead up to me alone to support its weight, no matter how great.
211 to be sure, it is unseemly and exceedingly patronizing to wish to set limits to another’s efforts and, as cicero says, to desire moderation in a matter where the greater is the better.
212 in undertaking so great a venture, it was inevitable that i either fail or succeed.
213 if i should succeed, i do not see why what is praiseworthy to do for ten theses should be considered blameworthy to do for nine hundred.
214 if i should fail, they will have grounds for accusing me if they hate me – and for excusing me if they love me.
215 indeed, a young man who has failed through lack of intelligence or want of learning in so serious and great an undertaking will certainly be more worthy of forgiveness than of blame.
216 indeed, according to the poet: “if strength fails, audacity will surely be praised; and in great endeavours, it is enough to have willed.”   and if many in our age, imitating gorgias of leontini, have been accustomed, not without praise, to propose a disputation not merely on nine hundred questions but on all questions related to all arts, why should i not be allowed to engage without blame in debate on questions that, though indeed numerous, are at least precise and determined?
217 but they say this is needless and audacious.
218 yet i contend that i did this not needlessly but out of necessity, and if they should consider my philosophical method, they must admit, albeit reluctantly, that it is clearly necessary.
219 this is because those who have devoted themselves to any one of the schools of philosophy, siding for instance with thomas or with scotus, who are now most in fashion, can surely put their doctrines to the test in the discussion of but a few questions.
220 as for myself, however, i have resolved – in order not to swear by the words of another – to pore over all masters of philosophy, to examine every page, and to become acquainted with all schools.
221 therefore, since i was to speak about all of these doctrines (lest i seem committed to advocating one in particular as a result of having neglected the others), it was impossible for there not to be very many questions concerning all of them together, even if only a few questions were proposed in regard to each.
222 nor should anyone condemn me on this account, for “wherever the tempest carries me, there i am brought as a guest.”   for it was a rule observed by all the ancients in studying every kind of writer never to pass over any commentaries they were able to read, and this is especially true for aristotle, who for this reason was called by plato ναγνώστης; that is, “the reader.”   and confining oneself within a single porch or academy certainly does show narrowness of mind.
223 nor can anyone rightly choose his own doctrine from them all unless he has first made himself familiar with each of them.
224 in addition, there is in each school something distinctive that is not shared in common with any other.
225 and now, to begin with our own, to whom philosophy came last, we find in john [duns] scotus something lively and meticulous, in thomas [aquinas] a balanced solidity, in giles [of rome] a neat precision, in francis [of meyronnes] a penetrating acuteness, in albert [the great] an ancient and grand breadth, in henry [of ghent], as it has seemed to me, a constant and venerable solemnity.
226 among the arabs, we find in averroes an unshaken firmness, in avempace, as in al-farabi, a thoughtful seriousness, in avicenna a divine platonic sublimity.
227 among the greeks, philosophy is certainly limpid in general and pure in particular; in simplicius it is rich and copious, in themistius elegant and compendious, in alexander [of aphrodisias] learned and self-consistent, in theophrastus seriously worked out, in ammonius smooth and agreeable.
228 and if you turn to the platonists, to mention but a few, in porphyry you will be pleased by the wealth of his topics and the complexity of his religion; in iamblichus you will be awed by an occult philosophy and the mysteries of the barbarians; in plotinus there is no one thing in particular for you to admire, for he offers himself to admiration in every part.
229 even the platonists themselves struggle to understand his wisely allusive discourse when he speaks divinely of things divine and when he speaks of human things in a way that far surpasses humanity.
230 i shall pass over the more recent ones, such as proclus, who abounds in asian fecundity, and those who stem from him, hermias, damascius, olympiodorus, and many others, in all of whom there always shines forth that τ Θεον – that is, that divine something which is the distinctive mark of the platonists.
231 one should also add that when some school attacks the more established truths and derisively slanders valid arguments of reason, it strengthens rather than weakens the truth, which – like a flame that is stirred by agitation – is thus enkindled rather than extinguished.
232 spurred on by this reasoning, i wished to bring to light the opinions not only of a single doctrine (as some would have liked) but of every school of thought, so that, through the comparison of many schools and the discussion of several philosophies, that “effulgence of truth” which plato mentions in his letters might more intensely illuminate our minds, like the sun rising from the deep.
233 inasmuch as all wisdom has flowed from the barbarians to the greeks and from the greeks to us, what would have been the point of dealing only with the philosophy of the latins – that is, of albert, thomas, scotus, giles, francis, and henry – while leaving the greek and arab philosophers aside?
234 thus, our authors have always seen fit, in matters of philosophy, to ground themselves in foreign discoveries and to perfect the doctrines of others.
235 what point would there have been in dealing with natural things alongside the peripatetics without also invoking the platonic academy?
236 their doctrine on divine things, as augustine shows, has always been considered the most sacred of all philosophies; this is a doctrine that, as far as i know, is now being brought forward by me for the first time after many centuries (may my words inspire no envy) to be submitted for public debate.
237 and what would have been the point of dealing with the opinions of others, no matter how many there were, if i – like he who comes to the banquet of the wise without contributing anything – were to bring nothing of my own, nothing born of and elaborated with my own mind?
238 it is certainly undignified, as seneca says, to know only through books and, as though the discoveries of our ancestors had barred the way to our own industriousness and the power of nature were exhausted in us, to bring about from ourselves nothing that, even if it fell short of demonstrating the truth, might at least hint at it from afar.
239 for if a farmer hates sterility in his field and a husband hates it in his wife, the divine mind will certainly hate even more the barren soul that is joined and associated with it, insofar as it is a far nobler offspring that is desired.
240 hence, i have not been content simply to add, beside the common doctrines, many principles taken from the ancient theology of hermes trismegistus, many more drawn from the teachings of the chaldeans and pythagoras, and many others deriving from the more secret mysteries of the hebrews, and i have also proposed for disputation a good many discoveries and reflections of my own, both on things natural and divine.
241 in the first place, i have proposed the concord of plato and aristotle, believed by many before me but adequately proven by none.
242 among the latins, boethius promised to do it, but there is no evidence that he ever did what he always wished to do.
243 among the greeks, simplicius made the same declaration, and if only he had fulfilled his promise!
244 augustine, too, writes that there were not a few academics who tried with their most subtle arguments to prove the same thing – namely, that the philosophies of plato and aristotle were one.
245 likewise john [philoponus] the grammarian, who, although he says that plato differs from aristotle only for those who do not understand what plato says, nevertheless left it to posterity to prove.
246 i have also added many theses in which i maintain that several statements by thomas and scotus that are thought to be discordant are in agreement, and many others in which i maintain the same about statements by averroes and avicenna.
247 in the second place, i have presented not only my discoveries in aristotelian and platonic philosophy but also seventy-two new theses, which i have proposed both in physics and in metaphysics.
248 whoever grasps these theses will be able – if i am not mistaken, as i shall soon see – to solve any question put to him regarding things natural and divine by a method quite unlike that of the philosophy taught in schools and cultivated by the doctors of this age.
249 nor should anyone be much amazed, fathers, that in my youth, at a tender age at which (as some propose) i should hardly have been allowed to read the works of others, i wish to introduce a new philosophy; instead, let this philosophy be either praised if it is defensible or condemned if it is refutable.
250 when my discoveries and my writings are eventually judged, one should tally up not the years of their author but rather their merits or demerits.
251 there is, moreover, still another method of philosophizing (one that is carried out with numbers), which i have presented as new but which is in fact old, and was observed by the ancient theologians, by pythagoras in particular, by aglaophamos, philolaus, and plato, and by the earlier platonists.
252 but in our age this doctrine, like other famous ones, has so fallen into disuse on account of the carelessness of posterity that hardly any traces of it remain.
253 plato writes in the epinomis that, among all liberal arts and contemplative sciences, the principal and most divine is the science of numbers.
254 and again, asking why man is the wisest of animals, he answers: “because he knows how to count.” aristotle also mentions this response in his problems.
255 abumasar writes that it was a saying of avenzoar of babylon that he who knows how to count knows all things.
256 none of these things could possibly have been true if they had taken the art of numbering to be that same one at which merchants are now especially skilful.
257 plato attests to this as well when he openly warns us not to believe that this divine arithmetic is the mathematics of the merchants.
258 since it seemed to me, after long nights of study, that i had thoroughly examined that arithmetic which is so praised, i made up my mind to put these matters to the test and promised that i would answer in public, through the art of numbering, the seventy-four questions that are considered most important in matters natural and divine.
259 i have also proposed some theses regarding magic in which i have shown that there are two forms of magic: one is based entirely on the deeds and powers of demons (and is, in truth, an execrable and monstrous thing); the other, when keenly examined, is nothing but the absolute perfection of natural philosophy.
260 the greeks mentioned both of them, but they call the former γοητεαν (dignifying it in no way with the name of magic), whereas they call the latter by the proper and exclusive name of μαγεαν, the perfect and highest wisdom, as it were.
261 as a matter fact, as porphyry says, “magus” in the persian language means the same as “expert and interpreter of divine things” in ours.
262 so, fathers, there is a great or even the greatest difference and disparity between these two arts.
263 the former is condemned and abhorred not only by the christian religion but by all laws and every well-ordered state.
264 the latter is approved and embraced by all wise men and by all peoples devoted to heavenly and divine things.
265 the former is the most deceitful of arts; the latter is the highest and most holy philosophy.
266 the former is sterile and vain; the latter is sure, reliable, and firm.
267 the former has always been concealed by whoever has practiced it because it would have brought shame and disrepute to anyone who wrote about it, whereas the highest literary renown and glory have since antiquity almost always been sought from the latter.
268 no philosopher, nor any man eager to learn the good arts, has ever applied himself to the study of the former, but pythagoras, empedocles, plato, and democritus crossed the seas to learn the latter, taught it when they returned, and considered it chief among the arcane doctrines.
269 the former is neither based on any principles nor approved by any reliable author; the latter, ennobled, as it were, by the most celebrated parents, has two authors above all: zalmolxis, who was imitated by abaris the hyperborean, and zoroaster, not the one of whom perhaps you are thinking but the son of oromasius.
270 if we ask plato what the magic of both these men is, he will answer in the alcibiades that the magic of zoroaster is nothing other than that science of divine things in which the kings of the persians educated their sons so that they might learn to rule their state in accordance with the example of the order of the universe.
271 and in the charmides he will answer that the magic of zamolxis is the medicine of the soul, or that medicine by which temperance is obtained for the soul, just as by the other medicine health is obtained for the body.
272 afterward, charondas, damigeron, apollonius, osthanes, and dardanus followed in their footsteps.
273 and so did homer, who likewise concealed this wisdom, just as he concealed all the others, beneath the wanderings of his ulysses, as i shall eventually prove in my poetic theology.
274 eudoxus and hermippus also followed this path, and so, too, did almost everyone else who has assiduously investigated the pythagorean and platonic mysteries.
275 among the later philosophers, then, i find three who have got a whiff of it: the arabian al-kindi, roger bacon, and william of paris.
276 plotinus also mentions it, where he shows that a magus is the minister and not the maker of nature.
277 that most wise man approves and justifies this kind of magic, so abhorring the other that, invited to the rites of evil demons, he says that it was more fitting for them to come to him than for him to go to them.
278 and rightly so, for just as the former makes man a slave and a minion of wicked powers, the latter makes him their lord and master.
279 the former, in the end, cannot claim for itself the name either of art or of science, whereas the latter, full as it is of the loftiest mysteries, comprises the deepest contemplation of the most secret things and ultimately the knowledge of all nature.
280 the latter, in calling out, as it were, from their hiding places into the light the good powers sown and scattered here and there in the world by god’s beneficence, does not so much perform miracles as sedulously act as the servant of nature, which in turn performs them.
281 the latter has quite profoundly probed into that harmony of the universe that the greeks more expressively call συμπθειαν, and has discerned the mutual kinship that natures share.
282 it assigns to each thing its innate charms (which are called the υγγες of the magicians) and brings out into the open, as if it were itself their cause, the miracles lying hidden in the recesses of the world, in the womb of nature, in the mysterious storerooms of god.
283 just as the farmer marries elm to vine, so does the magus marry earth to heaven – that is, the lower things to the endowments and powers of the higher.
284 hence, the latter is consequently revealed to be just as divine and salutary as the former is monstrous and harmful.
285 it is precisely on this account that the former, in subjecting man to the enemies of god, drives him away from god, whereas the latter stimulates him to admire god’s works, which is the state of mind that most surely gives rise to well-disposed faith, hope, and charity.
286 for nothing better induces us to religion and to the worship of god than the assiduous contemplation of his wonders.
287 once we have aptly examined them by means of this natural magic i am discussing, we shall be all the more ardently aroused to the worship and love of their creator, and shall be forced to sing: “the heavens are full, all the earth is full with the majesty of thy glory.”   but this is enough on magic, regarding which i have said this much because i know that there are many who, just as dogs always bark at strangers, likewise often hate and condemn what they do not understand.
288 i come now to those things that i deduced from the ancient mysteries of the hebrews and that i cite as confirmation of the sacrosanct and catholic faith.
289 so that these things not be considered, by those who are ignorant of such matters, imaginary trifles or the fables of storytellers, i wish to explain to all men what they are and what they are like; where they come from; by whom and by how many enlightened authors they are confirmed; and how enigmatic, how divine, how necessary they are to those of our own faith for the safeguard of our religion against the importunate calumnies of the jews.
290 not only the celebrated hebrew doctors but also some among our own, such as esdras, hilary, and origen, write that moses received from god on the mount not only the five books of the law that he bequeathed to posterity but also a true and more secret exposition of the law.
291 god commanded him to proclaim the law to the people but never to put the interpretation of the law into writing, nor divulge it, but to communicate it only to jesu nave, who would in turn reveal it, under a solemn vow of secrecy, to his successors among the high priests.
292 the simple story was sufficient to recognize now god’s power, now his wrath against the wicked, his mercy toward the good, or his justice before all.
293 divine and salutary precepts were sufficient to learn about the goodly and blessed life, the worship of true religion.
294 but to make public to the populace the most secret mysteries and the profoundest arcana of divinity concealed beneath the bark of the law and the rough vestiture of language, what else could this have been but to give holy things to the dogs and to cast pearls before swine?
295 therefore, the custom of keeping from the masses these things that were to be conveyed only to the perfect (among whom only paul declared that he wished to speak of wisdom) derived not from human counsel but from divine commandment and was a practice that the ancient philosophers solemnly observed.
296 pythagoras wrote nothing but a few insignificant things that he entrusted to his daughter dama on his deathbed.
297 the sphinxes carved on the temples of the egyptians admonished them that the mystical doctrines should be kept inviolate from the profane multitude by the knots of enigmas.
298 plato, writing certain things to dionysius regarding the supreme substances, explained: “it is necessary to write in enigmas, for should this letter perchance fall into the hands of others, they would then be unable to understand what i have written to you.”  aristotle used to say that the books of the metaphysics, in which he deals with divine things, were published and unpublished.
299 what else?
300 according to origen, jesus christ, the teacher of life, revealed many things to his disciples, which they refused to write down so that these things would not be communicated to the common people.
301 this is conclusively confirmed by dionysius the areopagite, according to whom the secret mysteries were transmitted to the founders of our religion, “κ νος ες νον, δι μσου λγου” – that is, from mind to mind – without writing, through the intercession of the word.
302 once the law’s genuine interpretation, which god conveyed to moses, had been revealed in this same private way, it was called “cabala,” which means to the hebrews what “reception” means to us (doubtlessly because this doctrine was received not through written documents but through orderly successions of revelations from one man to another, almost by hereditary right).
303 however, after cyrus restored the hebrews from the babylonian exile, and once the temple had been rebuilt under the rule of zerubbabel, the hebrews turned their minds toward the reestablishment of the law.
304 esdras (who was then the leader of the people), having amended the books of moses, clearly realized that – following the exiles, the massacres, the flights and captivity of the people of israel – the custom instituted by their ancestors for handing down the doctrines could no longer be preserved and that the mysteries of this divinely conveyed celestial doctrine would fade into oblivion in the absence of written documents since they could no longer endure in memory alone.
305 thus, he decided that those sages who were still alive should be convened, that each of them should share with the others whatever he could recall of the mysteries of the law, and that scribes be employed to record it all in seventy volumes (roughly the same as the number of sages in the sanhedrin).
306 so that you need not believe only me, fathers, hear what esdras himself says: “at the end of forty days, the most high spoke, saying, ‘that which you first wrote, set forth clearly so that the worthy and unworthy alike may read it, but keep to yourself the most recent seventy books so that you may hand them over to the wisest among your people.
307 in them are the vein of intellect, and the fountain of wisdom, and the river of science.’  and i did so.
308 these are the words of esdras to the letter.
309 these are the books of the science of the cabala.
310 these tomes, as esdras rightly proclaimed, clearly and from the outset, contain a vein of understanding – in other words, the ineffable theology of the supersubstantial deity – a font of wisdom that is the exact metaphysics of the intelligible and angelic forms, and the river of science that is the most steadfast philosophy of natural things.
311 pope sixtus iv – who immediately preceded innocent viii, under whom we live in happiness – arranged, with the utmost care and concern, for these books to be translated into latin for the common good of those of our faith.
312 at the time of his death, three of them were already available in latin.
313 these books are held in such religious awe by the jews of today that no one under the age of forty is permitted to approach them.
314 i purchased these books at no little cost to myself, and when i perused them with the greatest diligence and unstinting labour, i saw in them (as god is my witness) not so much the mosaic as the christian religion.
315 here is the mystery of the trinity, here the incarnation of the word, here the divinity of the messiah; here of original sin, of its expiation through christ, of the heavenly jerusalem, of the fall of the demons, of the hierarchy of the angels, of purgatory, of the punishments in hell.
316 i saw the same things that we read every day in paul, dionysius, jerome, and augustine.
317 as for those matters pertaining to philosophy, it truly seems you are hearing pythagoras or plato, whose conclusions bear such affinity to the christian faith that our own augustine pronounced immense gratitude to god that the platonic books made their way into his hands.
318 on the whole, there is no point of controversy between us and the jews on which the latter could not be refuted and convinced by means of the cabalistic books, so that no corner will remain in which they may take refuge.
319 on this matter, i have a most trustworthy witness in the most erudite antonius chronicus, who, at a banquet at his house at which i was present, heard with his own ears dactylus the jew himself, an expert in this science, wholeheartedly acknowledge the christian tenet of the trinity.
320 but to return to reviewing the theses of my disputation, i have also presented my own interpretation of the songs of orpheus and zoroaster.
321 orpheus is extant among the greeks in an almost complete text; zoroaster is lacunose among the greeks but among the chaldeans is read in a more complete text.
322 both are credited with being the fathers and authors of ancient wisdom.
323 indeed, to say nothing of zoroaster, who is often mentioned by the platonists and always with the utmost veneration, iamblichus of chalcis writes that pythagoras regarded orphic theology as the model on which he fashioned and formed his own philosophy.
324 as a matter of fact, it is said for this reason alone that the pythagorean maxims are thought to be sacred, for they derive from the orphic teachings; from this first source flowed forth the secret doctrine of numbers and everything that is great and sublime in greek philosophy.
325 however, orpheus (as was the practice among the ancient theologians) so well concealed the mysteries of his dogmas under the coverings of fables and hid them under the veil of poetry that, if one were to read his hymns, one would believe there is nothing more behind them than the most commonplace tales and trifles.
326 i wished to say this so as to make known what trouble and what difficulties i faced in freeing from the tangle of riddles and the obscurity of fables the meaning of this secret philosophy, especially since i could not rely on assistance in a matter so important, so hidden and unexplored, from the work or diligence of any other interpreters.
327 nevertheless, the dogs have barked that i have ostentatiously accumulated a large number of minutia and trivialities, as if all of them were not the most ambiguous and controversial questions over which the principal academies are now in pitched battle; as if i myself had not studied many arguments that are wholly unknown to, and untried by, the very ones who carp at me and who believe themselves to be the noblest of philosophers.
328 indeed, i am so far removed from this fault that i took care to limit the disputation to as few theses as i could.
329 had i wished (as is customary among others) to dismember the disputation and chop it into pieces, the theses would have grown to a countless number.
330 and, to say nothing of all of the others, who does not know that i could have subdivided a single thesis of the nine hundred (the one, for example, on the reconciliation of the philosophies of plato and aristotle) into, say, six hundred or more without arousing the suspicion of padding the numbers by enumerating in detail all the points on which others think they disagree and i believe they agree?
331 there can be no doubt – this i shall declare, although it is neither modest nor in keeping with my character; this i shall nonetheless declare since those who envy and speak ill of me compel me to do so – that i have resolved through this congress of mine to demonstrate not so much that i know many things as that i know things that many do not know.
332 so that this may become clear to you by the facts, most reverend fathers, and so that my oration no longer postpone the object of your desire, most excellent doctors (whom not without great delight i see ready and, girded up, spoiling for a fight), let us take up ours arms, as if to the sound of the battle trumpet, and may the outcome be fruitful and favourable.
